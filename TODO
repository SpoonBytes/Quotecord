TODO:
	☐ Convert from pkg based solution to Electron based solution with electron-builder
		Ideally, Quotecord should exist as a tray application which Electron (thankfully) supports
			I need to find or create a icon
	☐ Configure token from the tray icon's menu
		This could either be done by opening the file and having the user insert their token,
		or by having an input field in the menu item itself.
