TODO:
	✔ Convert from pkg based solution to Electron based solution with electron-builder @done(18-04-22 19:22)
		Ideally, Quotecord should exist as a tray application which Electron (thankfully) supports
			I need to find or create a icon

		For now, I am using a general quote icon with the same color as Discord's logo.
	✔ Configure token from the tray icon's menu @done(18-04-23 11:20)
		This could either be done by opening the file and having the user insert their token,
		or by having an input field in the menu item itself.

		A context menu option was added that allows the user to open the config.json file 
		in their default editor.
